        The Virtual ECG Monitor is an innovative prototype designed to assist in the early detection of Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB), a common heart rhythm disorder that can lead to serious complications such as stroke and heart failure if left untreated. By leveraging advanced signal processing techniques, this tool analyzes uploaded ECG recordings to provide users with real-time insights into their heart health. Our mission is to empower individuals and healthcare professionals with accessible, reliable, and user-friendly technology to monitor and manage cardiovascular conditions effectively.

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Upload Your ECG File:</strong> Support for .csv and .dat formats ensures compatibility with most ECG devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Signal Processing:</strong> The system processes your ECG data using a mock algorithm (currently for demonstration purposes).</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Waveform Display:</strong> Visualize your ECG signal as a dynamic graph, with interactive controls to pause and scroll.</li>
            <li><strong>AFIB Detection Result:</strong> Receive a preliminary result indicating whether AFIB is detected (positive/negative).</li>

        At this prototype stage, the Virtual ECG Monitor uses a simplified algorithm that provides random detection results for demonstration purposes. This allows us to test the user interface and workflow while developing the core technology. The system is built using React for the frontend, with Material-UI for a polished and responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
